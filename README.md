# 📱 _Decentralized Crowdfunding Platform with Warranty attached NFT's_ 

_**A decentralized crowdfunding platform using blockchain is a platform where projects and businesses can raise funds without the need for intermediaries. The platform operates on a decentralized network of computers that record and verify all transactions.**_ <br />
_**The platform also utilizes a reputation system that rewards backers who provide accurate and helpful feedback to the project creators. This system encourages collaboration and ensures that project creators have access to valuable feedback from the community.**_ <br />

### 🎯 Our Goals :

1.  Access to capital: A decentralized crowdfunding platform can provide access to capital for projects and businesses that may not have been able to secure funding through traditional channels. This can result in increased innovation and development, as more projects can be funded and brought to market.
2.  Democratization: Decentralized crowdfunding platforms can democratize the funding process by allowing anyone to participate in the crowdfunding process. This can result in increased diversity of projects and ideas, as well as a more democratic distribution of funding.
3.  Global reach: Decentralization allows for a wider reach, enabling backers from any part of the world to participate in the campaigns. This can result in increased exposure and funding for projects, which can lead to faster growth and development.
4.  Efficiency: Smart contracts can automate the fund allocation process, making it more efficient and reducing the need for intermediaries. This can result in faster funding and project development.
5.  Transparency: Blockchain technology provides a transparent mechanism for fund allocation, eliminating the need for intermediaries and providing increased transparency and accountability to the crowdfunding process. This can result in increased trust and confidence in the platform. 

## 📝 Problem Statement

_📌 **Lack of transparency**_ <br/>
In a centralized platform, the fund allocation process is controlled by a single entity, which can lead to a lack of transparency and accountability.

_📌 **High transaction fees**_ <br/>
Centralized platforms charge high transaction fees for their services, which can discourage potential backers from participating in the crowdfunding campaigns.

_📌 **Limited access**_ <br/>
Centralized platforms have geographic restrictions that limit access to potential backers and restricts the scope of the campaigns.

_📌 **Fraud and security concerns**_ <br/>
 Centralized platforms are vulnerable to security breaches, hacking attacks, and fraudulent activities, which can result in loss of funds and damage to the reputation of the platform.
 
 
## 📝 Solution

_📌 **Transparency and accountability**_ <br/>
By leveraging blockchain technology, a decentralized crowdfunding platform can offer transparent and secure fund allocation. All transactions are recorded on a decentralized ledger, which can be accessed and verified by anyone. Smart contracts can automate the fund allocation process, ensuring that funds are released only when specific conditions are met, providing transparency and accountability to the crowdfunding process.

_📌 **Lower transaction fees**_ <br/>
Decentralized crowdfunding platforms can eliminate intermediaries, resulting in lower transaction fees for project creators and backers. This makes it more cost-effective for both parties to participate in the crowdfunding process.

_📌 **Wider reach**_ <br/>
Decentralization allows for a wider reach, enabling backers from any part of the world to participate in the campaigns. This can result in increased exposure and funding for projects, which can lead to faster growth and development.

_📌 **Security**_ <br/>
Blockchain technology provides a secure mechanism for fund allocation, eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing the risk of fraud and security breaches. Decentralization also means that there is no single point of failure, making the platform more resilient to attacks.

## 📝 Additional Feature

_📌 **Reputation system**_ <br/>
A reputation system can be implemented to encourage collaboration and ensure that project creators have access to valuable feedback from the community. Backers who provide accurate and helpful feedback can be rewarded with tokens, which can be used to purchase goods and services within the project ecosystem.
